# Overview

This is a guide for sharing tips and tricks in utilizing [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), an emulated Linux environment in Windows for networking purposes.

This guide includes a set of practical examples on how to utilize the tools for debugging problems, and best utilized in conjunction with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (requires administrative privileges) and other the [Windows Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite).

The guide can be found [here](https://fartbagxp.github.io/cygwin-installation).

For deeper dives into networking, I recommend [TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated).

## Run It Yourself

- Must have [mdbook cli binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases) installed.
- Run `make preview` and navigate to `localhost:3000` on your browser to see it.
